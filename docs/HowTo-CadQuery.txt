HowTo: Installation of CadQuery & CQ-Editor

1. URL
   https://github.com/CadQuery
	 
2. Docu
a) CadQuery:  https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery
b) CQ-Editor: https://github.com/CadQuery/CQ-editor
Each of them has got an individual installation procedure. But what is the
best way to install both together? Does a "cq-editor=master" also implies
a "cadquery=master"? This is not so clear, at the moment.

3. Creating the "sandbox" for CadQuery
Decribed from a view-point directly after a mamba-installation.
a) mamba env list
   You see only one environment, named "base". It is reserved for mamba,
   Never try to install something to "base".
b) mamba create --name "cqe-env"
   This will create an empty environment for CadQuery.
c) mamba env list
   Now we have 2 lines. But the asterisk still points to "base", which
   means that "base" is the active environment.
d) mamba activate cqe-env
e) mamba env list
   Now the asterisk has moved to "cqe-env". This is the ensvironment that
   we use for our installations.

3. Installation of CadQuery & CQ-Editor
a) make sure that "cqe-env" is active
b) mamba install -c conda-forge -c cadquery python=3.11 cadquery=master cq-editor=master
   "cadquery" appears twice in the command-line. The channels, the name after a -c option
   determines from where the packages should be fetched. In our case we have 2: "conda-forge"
   and "cadquery". The remaining commandline-arguments specify packages, here we have 3:
   "python", "cadquery" and "cq-editor". In principle the specification of only 
   cq-editor=master should be sufficient. This means you get the latest and greatest version
   of "cq-editor". But because it is not so clear, which version for "cadquery" is selected,
   I pin the version for cadquery and say "cadquery=master". Now we will the latest-and-
   greatest version of both. But it is still unclear, which python version be used, therefore
   I like also to pin "python" by specifying "python=3.11".
c) inspect the output of the last command
   There should be no errors. Sometimes they are somewhat hidden in the long output-list.

4. Start CQ-Editor
a) make sure that "cqe-env" is active. (should be the case from the last step)
b) cq-editor -h
   This should show the help of cq-editor.

5. Work done
a) make sure that "cqe-env" is active.
b) mamba deactivate
c) mamba env list         # only as confirmation
