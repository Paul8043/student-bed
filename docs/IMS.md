Internal Model Specification

The main focus here is how the wooden parts are joined together. For the frame the notches serve for this purpose. Jambs and ribs can be simply plugged into each other.

For the duckboard it looks different, here the junction is made with screws. The duckboard consists of two halves and they have to be connected with each other and both with the frame. In the corners the duckboard is bolted with 4 screws. In the middle the duckboard is only bolted with 2 screws. So, the jamb in the middle, with its 4 inserts, is shared by both duckboards and the batten on top belongs to both duckboards. This gives a stable connection and the optical appearance is pleasing.

The bed has to be demountable and because of this woodscrews would be a poor choice, it is much better to use screws with metrical threads. The screws need a metallic counterpart as a nut. But normal nuts would also not be a good choice, better to use inserts, they will remain all the time in the wood, they cannot get lost. The screws can be purchased by https://www.frantos.com (MPN 1102706065 & 1102706035). The inserts come from https://www.rampa.com/eu/en/ (MPN 420618001).

The inserts (Type SKD330) are for M6-screws, they need a pilot hole in the range from 10.0mm to 10.5mm. For hardwood, and if they are placed on the face, 10.5mm are highly recommended! But anyhow, for such things it is always a good idea to make a test sample first.
